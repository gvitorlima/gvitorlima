## Hello, my name is Gabriel Vitor

I only kill bugs...
And I create some in personal projects, but that's beside the point!

### A little bit about me!

>I'm a **backend** programmer with a keen interest in everything.  

I am currently working on creating and maintaining RESTFULL **API`s**, using **native PHP**, **PostgresSQL**, **Firebird** and **Laravel** as the main tools

### Studying and practicing

> Practice git versioning, general backend programming basics, such as:  
> design patterns, SOLID, security, optimization, scalability and performance...

Basic use of the terminal and Linux as a whole (Extra information. I'm using Arch (smiley face here)), database in general and whatever else I want to learn (Process of creating and validating a jwt token only for curiosity).
