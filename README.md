## Hello, my name is Gabriel Vitor

I kill bugs only...  
And I create some in personal projects, but that's beside the point!

### A little bit about me!

>I'm a **backend** programmer with a keen interest in everything.  

I am currently an intern and work on creating and maintaining **RESTful API`s**, using **PHP** and **FIREBIRD** as main tools.

### Studying and practicing

> Practice git versioning, general backend programming basics, such as:  
> design patterns, SOLID, security, optimization, scalability and performance...

Basic use of the terminal and Linux as a whole (Extra information. I'm using an Arch (smiley face here) ), database in general and whatever else makes me want to learn (Process of creating and validating a jwt token just out of curiosity).
